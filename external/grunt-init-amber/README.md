## Installation
Install [grunt-init](http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding) if you have not already done so.

Place this template in your `~/.grunt-init/` directory after installing grunt-init.
It is recommended to clone this template with git as follows:

```
git clone git://github.com/mkroehnert/grunt-init-amber.git ~/.grunt-init/amber
